jigdo wouldn't have gotten this far without the following people.
Thanks to...

Phil Hands
    for giving me an account on cdimage.debian.org and deciding to use
    jigdo as the main distribution scheme for Debian 3.0r0

Peter Jay Salzman
    for writing and maintaining the jigdo mini-HOWTO - also thanks to
    the translators: Conrad Wood, Elcio Mello, Marcelo Ramos

Steve McIntyre
    for his project JTE (Jigdo Template Extractor), which patches
    mkisofs to allow direct creation of .jigdo/.template files

Paul Bolle (and earlier Alexander Skwar)
    for maintaining the jigdo.spec.

Wookey
    for being the first person to actually try it out and give me
    feedback :)

Santiago Garcia Mantinan
    for lots of beta testing and for finding that cache bug 5 days
    before the Debian release

    generating the first .jigdo DVD files ever and for submitting it
    to the BSD ports collection

Peter Siering
    of c't magazine for feedback and using jigdo for the Heise VDR CDs

Anne Bezemer

    the world, from New Zealand to Germany!

    though! :-)

...and to numerous users for many "jigdo rocks" and "jigdo sucks"
mails.
