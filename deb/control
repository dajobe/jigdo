Description: Distribution of huge files - GTK+ download manager
 Jigsaw Download, or short jigdo, is a scheme developed primarily to
 make it easy to distribute huge filesystem images (e.g. CD (ISO9660)
 or DVD (UDF) images) over the internet, but it could also be used for
 other data which is awkward to handle due to its size, like
 audio/video files or large software packages.
 .
 jigdo tries to ensure that the large file is downloaded in small
 parts which can be stored on different servers. People who want to
 download the image do so by telling the jigdo download tool to
 process one ".jigdo" file; using it, jigdo downloads the parts and
 reassembles the image. jigdo-file is used to prepare the files for
 download.
 .
 This package contains "jigdo", the GTK+ download tool.
 .
 This package was built directly from the author's source package at
