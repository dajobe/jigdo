Changelog for Jigsaw Download                               -*- Text -*-
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current CVS version

  - jigdo-file: Added support for bzip2 (de)compression in .template
    files, as an alternative to zlib compression. Bzip2 is disabled by
    default (but may become the default in the future). Use --bzip and
    --gzip to switch between the two.
  - Patch by Jochen Hepp: New switch --scan-whole-file for "jigdo-file
    scan" command: Scan whole file instead of only first block
  - Patch by Jochen Hepp: New switch --no-greedy-matching for
    "jigdo-file make-template" prevents small matches from cancelling
    pending larger matches.
  - jigdo: Switched over from libwww to libcurl for downloads
  - jigdo-lite: Fixed regular expressions so they work with sed 4.1
    and non-GNU sed
  - jigdo-lite: --noask switch to allow running jigdo-lite from cron
    jobs (Silas Bennett)
  - jigdo-file: Bugfix for the code which deduces missing --image/
    --jigdo/--template arguments. Broken in 0.7.1, would deduce
    /x.iso.template from /x.iso, instead of /x.template (Adrian Bunk)
  - Fix for compilation on 64 bit architectures
  - Fixed "compiler recent enough" check in configure.ac for GCC 3.5+
  - Fixes for GCC 4.0

jigdo 0.7.1 -- Richard Atterer, 20 Jun 2004

  - Workaround for problems with big files (DVD images) when compiling
    with GCC 3.0 to 3.3.
  - Fix for Windows version: "wget: BUG: unknown command `timeout'" no
    longer occurs (was spurious anyway, but irritated many people)
  - Windows version compiled with GCC 3.4, can hopefully create big
    files (DVD images)
  - removed "too many files missing, won't attempt to download them
    from fallback mirror" logic in jigdo-lite because it was broken
  - .jigdo file format: Semantics of multiple [Image] sections have
    changed: Formerly, the idea was that one .jigdo could provide
    multiple images, but the idea never caught on and the idea "one
    .jigdo => one image" is firmly planted in people's minds now. The
    original incentive of allowing multiple [Image] sections was to
    make it possible to avoid duplication of .jigdo data, by providing
    all 7 CDs and the single DVD in one .jigdo. This duplication can
    now be avoided by [Include]ing the CDs' files from the DVD's,
    because all except the first [Image] section are ignored.
  - Fixed minor bug in jigdo-lite; it would sometimes abort even if no
    error code was returned by jigdo-file
  - GUI: Added code for processing of .jigdo files and [Include]
  - GUI: Added simple caching of downloaded data during .jigdo
    downloads
  - Bugfix for "jigdo-file make-image" (Steve McIntyre): Failed
    assertion `nextAlignedOff>off' and huge .template with >4GB image.
  - Bugfix for "jigdo-file make-template": Sometimes *incorrectly*
    reports: "You have found a bug". (Maxim Reznik)
  - Bugfix for "jigdo-file make-image": Handle I/O errors more
    gracefully (Brian Bennett)
  - Bugfix for "jigdo-file make-image" (Andreas Krüger): Do not
    allocate on the stack an array whose size is the number of matched
    files in the image. This gave, er, "funny" results with tens of
    thousands of matches... <slap>
  - Added comfortable debugging aids ("debug(fmt,...)", --debug=...)
  - Various documentation updates (manpages, Hacking.txt, changelog;-P)
  - Fix for build problems if size_t is 64 bits wide
  - Various fixes to allow compilation with GCC 3.4
  - Added unit tests for many parts of the code, with support in
    depend.awk
  - Fixed bug in html-beautify.awk
  - Vanity meter reports 26000 lines of code in 120 files

jigdo 0.7.0 -- Richard Atterer, 05 May 2003

  - GUI: Code for guessing the user's proxy settings. On Unix, reads
    the configuration files of various browsers. On Windows, reads the
    MSIE registry entries.
  - GUI: Single downloads (e.g. of .iso files) work, can be paused and
    continued, stopped and resumed.
  - GUI: Work on processing of .jigdo files is begun, but far from
    completed
  - Changed heuristics for "jigdo-file make-template". As with all
    heuristics, may actually turn out to be worse than before for some
    cases. However, with experiments of mine with i386 Debian DVD
    images, it resulted in a significant size reduction of the
    template.
  - Fix for bug in "make-template" which caused invalid template files
    to be generated sometimes. Funny how these make-template bugs keep
    popping up, I've already fixed about 5 of them! :-7
  - jigdo-lite: Fix for problem with the "read" builtin with some
    shells, e.g. dash
  - Fixed build problem on newer GCC 3.2
  - Source code now exceeds 20000 lines of code in almost 100 files.

jigdo 0.6.9 -- Richard Atterer, 19 Jan 2003

  - jigdo-lite: New batch mode - if you enter (or supply on the
    command line) several files/URLs, all the questions are only asked
    once before the first download. Furthermore, the program *always*
    asks for Debian/Non-US mirror URLs, it only asks for "Files to
    scan" once, it always downloads all images offered by all .jigdo
    files, and it does not stop immediately after errors, but
    continues with the next image.
  - You can enter URLs like "http://server/cd-{1_NONUS,2,3}.jigdo" and
    they'll be expanded to several separate URLs.
  - jigdo-lite: --scan command line option to avoid "Files to scan"
    question.
  - By popular demand, always use wget's --continue switch, except
    when fetching .jigdo files. This *will* cause severe breakage in
    the case that someone starts the download of a .template of
    fsn.hu's daily snapshot on one day, and resumes it the next day,
    but that's just a problem people will have to be aware of. :-/
  - jigdo-lite: Use --force-directories, allows --continue to be used
    for individual package downloads. (Previously, all downloaded
    .debs etc were stored directly in the tmp dir, so --continue could
    not be used because there are e.g. several files named
    "driver-1.bin" on Debian servers.)
  - jigdo-lite: Use a separate temporary dir for each new download.
    This allows you to run several jigdo-lite instances in the same
    dir at the same time.
  - jigdo-lite: When temporary dir is already present, scan its
    contents *before* downloading the first batch of files
    (Goswin Brederlow and others)
  - jigdo-file: Default for --min-length is now 1k by default, the
    hardwired absolute minimum is 256 bytes (used to be 4k/1k)
  - jigdo-file make-template: Changed heuristics when dropping
    possible file matches. Difficult to explain... essentially,
    together with the previous change, .template files for Debian CDs
    will get quite a bit smaller (Santiago Garcia Mantinan)
  - On Windows, fail with meaningful error for images >2GB (ATM, we
    don't have big file support with MinGW GCC)
  - Fixed compilation error with gcc 3 and --without-libdb (Attila)
  - Improved check for getopt_long support in configure script, it
    failed on FreeBSD 5 (Attila Nagy)
  - Added jigdo.pot to output, including initial German translation
  - configure script: Made --without-gui the default, as people have
    problems compiling with GTK & libwww, and the GUI is useless ATM
  - jigdo-lite: Misc fixes to make it work with mingw under Windows
  - jigdo-lite accepts --help and --version options
  - jigdo-lite: Changed timeout from wget's default 15 minutes to just
    30 seconds (only has an effect if no ~/.jigdo-lite present)
  - debian-mirrors.jigdo: Bugfix in creation script (HTTP/FTP paths on
    server were swapped), omit FTP URL if HTTP access possible
    (Phil Hands)
  - Build environment: Fix for bug in depend.awk, which made it output
    dependencies on .ih files when it shouldn't
  - jigdo-file make-template: Prevent infinite loop if I/O error
    occurs during scanning of files (Blars Blarson)
  - jigdo-file make-template: Fixed bug which could lead to
    segmentation faults if the image contained a long, but only
    partial match of a file, and another long partial match of another
    file within the "outer" partial match.
  - jigdo-file make-template: Bugfix - server line was sometimes added
    to [Image] section when using --merge
  - jigdo-file make-template: Fix for bug which is extremely unlikely
    in practice, caused segfault if read() returned <32 bytes or so
    while reading start of file.
  - jigdo-file make-template bugfix: Now creates properly quoted
    entries in [Parts] sections for filenames containing spaces or
    characters like "'\
  - Improved handling of invalid cache files (created if disc gets
    full during cache update): Instead of crashing, jigdo-file prints
    an error. However, libdb still corrupts the cache file.
    (Dmitry E. Melamud, Petr Slansky)

jigdo 0.6.8 -- Richard Atterer, 28 Jun 2002

  - jigdo-lite/mirror use "jigdo-file --no-cache" when reading
    downloaded files from tmp dir. Cache caused problems because ATM
    the Debian mirrors contain two different "driver-4.bin" files with
    identical timestamps. (Santiago Garcia Mantinan)
  - jigdo-lite uses "wget -e continue=off" for people who put
    continue=on into their wgetrc. (Iain Broadfoot)
  - At long last, succeeded in fully porting glibwww to Windows
  - Fixed bug in md5sum generation, which might lead to incorrect
    md5sums being generated, but in practice never has.

jigdo 0.6.7 -- Richard Atterer, 06 Jun 2002

  - Updated md5sum code, should now work on big-endian architectures
  - New version of jigdo-mirror supports include/exclude filtering
  - No longer use -g switch, unless --enable-debug used
  - Now compiles with gcc 3.1

jigdo 0.6.6 -- Richard Atterer, 17 May 2002

  - jigdo-lite/mirror: Template URLs can be relative to jigdo URL
  - jigdo-file: Any template URL added by default is relative
  - jigdo-lite: Don't use "wget -c" to get jigdo/template files -
    causes problems if the files are updated daily on the server
  - jigdo-file: >4GB file sizes now really supported on Linux
    (James W. Jayaputera) - does still not work under Windows.
  - jigdo-mirror is now installed by "make install"
  - Updated documentation, new manpage for jigdo-mirror
  - jigdo-file make-template: New --merge switch allows you to add
    this run's data to an existing jigdo file.
  - jigdo-file now writes out a Template-MD5Sum=... entry to the jigdo
    file. When using --merge, the entry can also be added to an
    existent [Image] section. jigdo-lite uses it to verify downloaded
    template data.
  - jigdo-file make-template: Always moves [Parts] section to the
    bottom of the file

jigdo 0.6.5 -- Richard Atterer, 17 Apr 2002

  - jigdo-lite: Better fallback handling, now also works for files
    that changed (rather than disappeared) on the server.
  - jigdo-lite: If ~/.jigdo-lite not present, try to fetch mirror info
    from /etc/apt/sources.list
  - portability fixes (Mattias Wadenstein)
  - jigdo GUI: Some more work done, but it's still not usable
  - new jigdo-mirror script (in the source tarball only)

jigdo 0.6.4 -- Richard Atterer, 02 Mar 2002

  - Fixed a make-template bug introduced in 0.6.3, which caused
    jigdo-file to crash if there are more than 32 files with identical
    content (Attila Nagy)
  - jigdo-lite: Allow customization of flags passed to jigdo-file and
    wget, by making it save and restore variables in ~/.jigdo-lite.
    For example, add "--uri Debian=http://myserver.lan/" to the
    definition of jigdoOpts to define an additional mirror (turns the
    selected mirrors into fallback mirrors).
  - jigdo-lite: Made script work with ash
  - Added configure check for _snprintf (needed for Windows)

jigdo 0.6.3 -- Richard Atterer, 24 Feb 2002

  - jigdo-file make-template: Some loop unrolling, some other
    optimizations, resulting in a speed increase of at least 30%!
  - FORMAT CHANGE of template files: Template data now includes
    RsyncSums - this will be useful in the future for aborting
    downloads early and when upgrading images to newer versions. This
    version still reads the old template format, but support for that
    will be dropped before 1.0.0.
  - jigdo-lite: Can now supply >1 image sections in .jigdo files
  - jigdo-lite: Support for gzipped .jigdo files
  - jigdo-lite: Added a small manpage
  - jigdo-lite: Use "wget --dot-style=mega --passive-ftp"
  - Really fixed <sstream> issues this time - by not using sstream at
    all. (It is not possible to implement an sstream class for the
    iostream supplied with Debian Potato's GCC 2.95)
  - Can now build a .deb just by executing "deb/rules"
  - configure: Can now use --without-gui to prevent jigdo GUI from
    getting built and installed (does not work with "deb/rules")
  - Added jigdo.spec for building of RPMs (Alexander Skwar)
  - Slightly changed the way that missing --image/--jigdo/--template
    arguments are deduced from other parameters. (Thomas Arnold)
  - Fixes to make jigdo-file build on 64-bit architectures
  - Changed abbreviation of "md5sum" command from "md" to "md5". That
    breaks compatibility, but I keep typing "md5"... :)
  - Small hack to make "jigdo-file md5 /some/path" include the leading
    "/" in its output.
  - jigdo-lite: Fix for obscure problem with "sed /foo/!p" on BSD and
    some Linux versions - use "egrep -v foo" instead (Attila Nagy)

jigdo 0.6.2 -- Richard Atterer, 26 Jan 2002

  - Added this changelog file to the distribution! :-)
  - gettext support (but no translations are present yet)
  - Portability fixes to jigdo-lite (Anne Bezemer)
  - Portability fixes to the jigdo-file code (for RedHat/Mandrake
    systems, systems without <sstream> such as Debian Potato)
  - Support for fallback servers in jigdo-lite
  - Support for fallback servers in jigdo-file, in the form of a new
    "print-missing-all" command
  - First upload of jigdo packages to the Debian archive

jigdo 0.6.1 -- Richard Atterer, 17 Dec 2001

  - Changelog lost

jigdo 0.6.0 -- Richard Atterer, 15 Nov 2001

  - Because the "proper jigdo" (the GTK+ download manager type app) is
    not going to be finished anytime soon, I've written a small shell
    script called "jigdo-lite" which does an equivalent job. It
    downloads files with wget and assembles them using jigdo-file.
    jigdo-lite can "upgrade" old images to a newer version.
  - Very first, ***pre-alpha*** version of the GTK+ jigdo application.
    There is no download capability or other functionality present at
    all yet.
  - As of a few days ago, the first beta site offering downloads of
    Debian 2.2r4 via jigdo is available on cdimage. Thanks for the
    account to Phil Hands!

jigdo 0.5.3 -- Richard Atterer, 13 Sep 2001

  - *** jigdo-file is finished! ***
    With the introduction of a cache for file checksums, it is finally
    possible in practice to let it loose on a Debian archive mirror.
  - Update and large extension of the documentation.
  - Now compiles with GCC 3.
  - Now compiles under Windows! You do not even need Cygwin; plain
    mingw is sufficient.
  - Numerous small fixes and changes. Source code now exceeds 10000
    lines of code.

jigdo 0.5.2 -- Richard Atterer, 2 Sep 2001

  - Would you believe it, documentation!!! (in the form of a manpage)
  - "print-missing" sub-command for jigdo-file allows for mirror
    selection etc - more than the old PIK's functionality is now
    present
  - Major internal extensions (nearly 2000 lines of code) which don't
    show now, but which will eventually come in handy for the GUI tool

jigdo 0.5.1 -- Richard Atterer, 22 Jul 2001

  - Can now merge files into a half-finished image with >1 jigdo-file
    invocations. This will be useful e.g. to "upgrade Debian CD
    images", i.e. you can take some .debs from the old CD, so they
    needn't be downloaded again.
  - Can assign labels to input file locations, e.g. "--label
    /opt/mirrors/debian=Debian"
  - Cleanup & extension of .jigdo file format

jigdo 0.5.0 -- Richard Atterer, about 20 Jun 2001

  - Initial release, not very usable.

jigdo 0.0.0 -- Richard Atterer, December 2000

  - Discussion on debian-cd, jigdo enters vapourware stage.
