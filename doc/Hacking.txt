Hacking the jigdo source code
=============================

This file is not very organized... if in doubt, use the source, Luke!

Use --enable-debug when hacking the source, this enables quite a few
additional sanity checks (the "Paranoid()" assertions - the "Assert()"
assertions are always enabled), #defines GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED, etc.

Bootstrapping the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you checkout the code from CVS or download the CVS snapshot, some
additional files have to be generated - in the jigdo release tarballs,
these files are already present.

The Makefiles automatically handle regeneration of those files if they
are not present; the only thing that you need to do manually is to
invoke autoconf to create the configure script, then you can do
"./configure --enable-debug ..." and "make" as usual.

Additional tools required for bootstrapping the code:

 - autoconf, to create the configure script
 - docbook-utils (docbook2html, docbook2man), to generate HTML
   documentation and manpages from the SGML in the "doc" subdirectory.
 - the gettext tools (msgfmt), to generate the .gmo files in
   the "po" subdirectory.
 - glade, to generate "src/gtk/interface.cc" from "jigdo.glade"
 - awk (or gawk/mawk), to generate "src/Makedeps" and to post-process
   "src/gtk/interface.cc"

On Debian systems, bootstrapping and compiling is possible simply by
typing "deb/rules".


Patches
~~~~~~~
Small bugfixes are very welcome, just send them to the mailing list.

Before starting anything bigger, better check with me whether it
coincides with my ideas - just to avoid frustration later on. I'm
pretty open to all ideas, though, especially if they save me some
work. :)


Sub-projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are some things I'd *love* to see done by somebody else:

Windows/Solaris/BSD/MacOS porting:

  ATM, I test and build jigdo on Linux and Windows, and occasionally
  on Solaris/BSD. Especially maintaining the Windows port is a bit of
  work...

  It'd also be nice if someone ensured that it builds on
  Redhat/SuSE/Mandrake, and maintained the jigdo.spec file.

CGI-like program for on-the-fly creation from .jigdo/.template files:

  With Debian, we have lots of mirror admins who have the bandwidth to
  host CD images, but not the disc space. They'd like a CGI-like
  program which generates a pseudo dirlisting with .iso links in it,
  and, when such an .iso link is downloaded, it creates the .iso
  data from the .jigdo/.template files and a local Debian mirror
  _on_the_fly_ as it is being sent over the net.

  NB however: This *cannot* be a CGI for performance reasons and
  because it must support HTTP/1.1 ranges (i.e. resuming of
  downloads). Also, it will be necessary to "pre-process" the
  .template file because repeatedly ungzipping it would be too slow.

  If not a CGI, what form should it have? I don't know - I'd go for an
  Apache module, but Attila Nagy tells me Apache needs too much memory
  if you have many thousand concurrent downloads. Maybe one could add
  the functionality to an existing small httpd?

".rawtemplate" support:

  It is possible to make .jigdo creation for Debian CDs much faster
  by hacking mkisofs to support more direct output of .jigdo/.template
  files:

  First, change mkisofs to output not .iso format, but a special
  ".rawtemplate" (or whatever) format. That format is similar to the
  normal .template format, except that files are not referenced by
  their md5sum, but by their filename, and that none of the data is
  compressed. This should be quite simple, and thus the modifications
  to mkisofs should be few and small, making it more likely that such
  a patch is accepted by mkisofs upstream.

  Next, the .rawtemplate is piped into jigdo-file, which creates
  .jigdo and .template files as usual. However, due to its cache, it
  won't need to read the files' contents to know their md5sum, so the
  overall process is much faster.


Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Both jigdo-file and jigdo use gettext, translations are welcome.
Please announce your efforts on the mailing list before you start, to
avoid duplication of effort.

Note: Don't translate any of the strings beginning with '#'. glade
doesn't allow me to selectively switch off the "gettextizing" of some
strings, and it would make editing the .glade file awkward if I left
those strings empty, so I'm marking these string with the '#'.


Directory layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

src:

    Files which don't belong into one of the subdirs... Also contains
    lots of stuff from before the point where I started creating
    subdirs - much of this should move into a subdir sooner or later.

src/net: Low-level network access.

    I'm not entirely happy with libwww and have vague plans to switch
    away from it once something better is available, so all code
    accessing libwww should be in this dir *only*, to make it
    easier to rip out.

    The "something better", BTW, would ideally be the Mozilla HTTP
    code, but ATM this isn't available as a separate library; you'd
    have to hack Mozilla to extract it.

    Required features for any replacement for libwww are HTTP/1.1
    support (both pipelining and ranges), multiple simultaneous
    connections (either multi-threaded or single-threaded with
    select()) and portability to Windows.

    Files in this dir may make calls to glib, but not gtk.

src/job: Application logic

    A "job" is a certain task, e.g. downloading an URL, processing a
    .jigdo file etc. For the gtk frontend, one job corresponds to one
    line in the lower part of the window - but this visualisation is
    the gtk GUI's decision.

    All jobs are classes in namespace "Job". Each such class declares
    a pure virtual child class (i.e. an interface) named "IO", which
    the code of the user interface needs to implement. For example,
    Job::SingleURL::IO is implemented by some code in the src/gtk
    directory, which when called sets up some gtk widgets.

    Files in this dir may make calls to glib, but not gtk.

src/gtk: GTK+ graphical user interface

    Provides a way to access the facilities of "jobs" via gtk widgets
    etc. This is the only dir whose files may make calls to gtk (and
    of course also glib).

src/util: Independent small helper classes

    Something goes in here if all of the following is true:
        - It is a single header file, optionally accompanied by a
          single .cc file and/or a corresponding *test.cc file
        - It accesses neither gtk nor glib
        - It is a small, reusable tool, maybe useful for other projects

BTW, I try at all costs only to use C libraries from the code, never
C++ libraries. You save yourself a lot of trouble that way, IMHO.


Code style
~~~~~~~~~~
You're not required to adhere to my rules here, but maybe you'll find
them useful...

I use K&R-style indentation, indenting by 2 spaces for each level of
indentation. I dislike using tabs in the source because it seems
people can never agree on a value for the tab indentation. Emacs can
be told never to generate tabs when indenting code; see below.

Source files in different directories must not have the same leafname,
or depend.awk and also #include will break. (IMHO identical leafnames
are also a source of confusion.)

Functions/methods should not be much longer than one screen. Source
files should never be larger than 1000 lines, and probably not even
larger than 500 lines. I'm perfectly aware that the code violates
these rules all the time. ;-/

All code must, *MUST* be commented.

If possible, larger components should be accompanied by a *-test.cc
file which tests the code. If the name of the file is "foo-test.cc"
(with a "-"), depend.awk will automatically generate a simple Makefile
entry. If that entry is not sufficient, call the file "footest.cc" and
manually add a Makefile rule.

Lines must not be longer than 77 characters. To format comments to
exactly that width, and also never to use tabs for indentation, use
this in your ~/.emacs:

(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (lambda () (interactive) (setq fill-column 77) (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)))

Don't use reference parameters if a function/method writes to its
args, use pointers instead. If I call a function, I want to see that
I'm calling it as "function(&data)", so "data" may be modified.

Don't use multiple inheritance, except if all but one of the base
classes are completely abstract (i.e. are "interfaces").

Don't have identically named classes in different namespaces, big
confusion will ensue. (Don't over-use namespaces in the first place.)


Header files (.fh, .hh, .ih)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To avoid excessive recompilation, I use three levels of headers.

.fh contain just forward declarations of classes and global functions,
and must not include .hh or .ih headers.

.hh are the main headers, and .ih files contain functions which are
compiled inline for --disable-debug and not inline for --enable-debug.
This is done by checking for the definedness of NOINLINE.

"make depend" updates the dependencies in src/Makedeps. The contents
of this file are then appended to the Makefile by the configure
script. See also the comments in scripts/depend.awk.


Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The application logic in job/ and net/ is separated from the front-end
in gtk/. Each Job corresponds to one action (downloading a file,
processing a .jigdo file), the GTK GUI decides to visualize this as
one line in the display.

The GTK code maintains a list of JobLines, each of which references a
Job of some kind. A simple type job is a SingleURL, which takes care of
downloading a single big file.

A more complicated job is the processing of a .jigdo file. This
involves a number of sub-jobs for downloading data. The "master" job
is a MakeImageDl, it starts other jobs for the individual downloads.

The action of *assembling* the data is not implemented as a job,
instead as a MakeImage object which is owned by the MakeImageDl and
fed data by it. See makeimage.hh.

Important for the UI: Any UI (whether GTK+ or other) is only allowed
to create and destroy top-level jobs. Any job created by a "master"
MakeImageDl can only be deleted by the same MakeImageDl. This means
that the GUI code which handles SingleURL GTK+ visualization must
distinguish between a "child mode" and "non-child mode".
