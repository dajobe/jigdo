----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the programs, execute:
    ./configure && make

After a successful build, you can install the program (by default into
/usr/local) with

   make install

To build Debian packages (.deb) from the sources, execute:
    deb/rules

To compile jigdo-file on the old Debian "potato" release, use:
    ./configure --without-libdb --without-gui && make

To build an RPM package (.rpm) from the sources, execute:
    rpmbuild -ta jigdo-x.y.z.tar.bz2

To build a .tar.bz2 with docs and statically linked binaries, execute:
    ./configure && make bindist

Apart from the usual options (see "./configure --help"), the configure
script also recognizes the following options:
  --without-libdb         Don't use libdb3 (it's necessary for jigdo-file's cache)
  --with-gui              Build the jigdo GTK+ GUI application [auto]
  --with-uint64=TYPE      Specify unsigned type of at least 64 bits [auto]
                          (Replace spaces with underscores in TYPE)
  --disable-nls           Disable multi-language support
  --enable-debug          Compile in lots of additional debugging code
  --disable-libwww-hacks  Don't compile fixed versions of some libwww
                          code (Try this if you see link errors/crashes)
